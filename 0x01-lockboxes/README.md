Graph Theory is a fundamental area of computer science that focuses on studying graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (also known as nodes or points) and edges (also known as arcs or lines).
There are two main types of graphs: directed and undirected. In a directed graph, each edge has an orientation, or a direction. In an undirected graph, there's no direction to the edges.

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is LIFO (Last In First Out), which means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
A Queue, on the other hand, is also a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is FIFO (First In First Out), which means the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
