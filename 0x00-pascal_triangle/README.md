Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that has a triangular shape with numbers. It starts with a '1' at the top. Each number below in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, one from the left and one from the right. If there's no number in the spot above, we just consider it as '0'.
Here's a simple representation of Pascal's Triangle:
``
     1
    1 1
   1 2 1
  1 3 3 1
 1 4 6 4 1
 ``
Pascal's Triangle has many interesting properties and is used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra and combinatorics. For example, the rows of Pascal's Triangle are powers of 11 (for the first few rows), and the sum of the elements of each row is a power of 2. It's also used in the binomial theorem.
