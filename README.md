Technical interviews are a common part of the hiring process for many tech companies. They are designed to assess your problem-solving skills, your understanding of algorithms and data structures, and your ability to write clean, efficient code.
Typically, you'll be asked to solve a coding problem on a whiteboard or in a shared coding environment. The interviewer is not just interested in whether you can solve the problem, but also in how you approach it, how you handle edge cases, and how you optimize your solution.
